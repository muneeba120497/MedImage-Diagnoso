# MedImage-Diagnoso
MedImage Diagnosio is a web application designed to analyze and diagnose medical images using Google’s Generative AI model (Gemini). 
The app allows users to upload medical images, which are then processed by the AI to provide a detailed analysis of any potential health conditions visible in the image. 
The platform displays the uploaded image, initiates a diagnostic chat session with the AI, and returns the analysis, helping medical professionals and patients gain insights into the images. 
The app is built using Streamlit for its user-friendly interface and integrates Google’s powerful AI capabilities for precise, text-based medical diagnoses.
